# File-Checker-for-csgo
This script writes the names of all game files to a separate file. If the game will be overloaded with different files, you can easily return to the original state by deleting files that did not exist at the time of creating the dump file.

For greater efficiency, it is recommended to reinstall the game before use and after the first launch of the game make a snapshot of all game files using this script.
